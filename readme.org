* Linux Setup
When first setting up any linux machine, there are things that I want that make it the best for me.
* Applications
** Syncthing
** Alacritty
** Emacs->Doom Emacs
** Neovim->NvChad
** Awesomewm

* Syncthing
** Install syncthing via command line
- sudo apt-get install syncthing
** Keep it running
- sudo systemctl enable syncthing@shakeeb.service --now

* Emacs->Doom Emacs
- Distrotube Tutorial for Ubuntu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37H7bD-G7nE
- Distrotube Tutorial for Arch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iab2z21cRqA
  - sudo pacman -Syyu
  - sudo pacman -S emacs git ripgrep fd
  - git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
  - .emacs.d/bin/doom install

* Alacritty
** Getting Opacity and nerd font
  - I used this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQdB_kHyZn8
  - Nerd Font Website: https://www.nerdfonts.com/
** Download nerd font (For me, I like Jetbrains Mono NF)
** Go to terminal
** Type following commands to get the files of nerd font and put them in font folder
- cd Downloads
- unzip “Zip file name”.zip -d “Folder named after nerd font”
  - If you do not have unzip command, you can install it via command line
- cd “Folder named after nerd font”
- cp -vf *.ttf ~/.local/share/fonts
  - You might have to create the folder if it is not there
- cd
  - Takes you to home directory
- cd .local
- cd share
- ls
  - List out contents to see if folder is there
- mkdir fonts
  - Make the directory if is not there
- fc-list | grep “Nerd Font name”
  - This command lets you see where files with this name are located

** Now that we have the nerd font in our system, lets go ahead and configure alacritty
** Open the terminal again or cd into the home folder
- cd .config
- ls
  - See if alacritty folder is there
  - If folder is not there, run
    - mkdir alacritty
- cd alacritty
- “Text editor of choice (I prefer vim/nvim)” alacritty.yml
** Within this file, we will go ahead and have the terminal a little transparent and set the nerd font
** Enter the following text into the file

window:
	opacity: 0.8

font:
	normal:
		family: “JetBrainsMono Nerd Font”
	size: 8

** Save the file
** If Alacritty is saying that .yml doesn’t work anymore and you have to switch to .toml, run this command in alacritty
- alacritty migrate
** Now we have a see through alacritty terminal with a nerd font

* Neovim->Nvchad
** Youtube Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtgo-nP_r8Y
** Make sure to install Neovim version 0.10 or above. (Arch is one command, Ubuntu requires steps) and also install git
- sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install neovim
- sudo apt-get install git
** Get Nerd Font for terminal
** Youtube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQdB_kHyZn8
** Refer to Alacritty for configuration
** Installing NvChad
** Github instructions: https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install

** Assuming that you do not have any neovim configuration yet, you can follow the next commands. If you do, you can back them up as shown in the video
- mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.backup
** You will go ahead and run the following commands
- rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
** To prevent any issues
- git clone https://github.com/NvChad/starter ~/.config/nvim
** Then you will open nvim by running
- nvim
** When you open it, it may ask you for an example custom fig. You can say no to that by typing “n” and then enter
** It will install all plugins
** Then after that, inside nvim, run the following command according to the github page
- :MasonInstallAll
** This allows for lsp (autocompletion like in vscode)
** If you want to change the theme, press the following keys (SPC means spacebar):
- SPC t h
** Most important command would probably be
- SPC c h
** This opens the cheat sheet
** To get syntax highlighting for certain languages, in nvim, run
- :TSInstall “language”
** You might need specific lsp, so run
- :Mason
** Then move to the language-server you want it for
** For Transparency:
- cd ~/.config/nvim/lua
- nvim chadrc.lua
** Right before the line “return M”, add these lines of code:
M.ui = {
	transparency = true;
}
** Save the file, exit nvim and enter again, and you should have transparency in nvim

* Awesome Config
** First we need to get the file that we will allow us to configure awesomewm
** After that, we will go ahead and get the customizatino
** Then we will add some last configurations to the file
** Run the following commands
*** Packages
**** There are some packages that will help elevate the experience
**** The following packages are:
***** sudo apt-get install picom
****** This package allows for transparency
***** sudo apt-get install nitrogen
****** Set wallpaper
***** sudo apt-get install dmenu
****** Better searching for applications
*** Commands
**** cd .config
**** ls
***** If awesome is not among the file directories, go ahead and make it by running
****** mkdir awesome
**** cd awesome
**** cp /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua ~/.config/awesome
**** ls
***** You should see a file named rc.lua
**** cd
**** git clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules --depth 1 -j 2 https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats.git
**** mv -bv awesome-copycats/{*,.[^.]*} ~/.config/awesome; rm -rf awesome-copycats
**** cp rc.lua.template rc.lua
*** Configuring the rc.lua file
**** Using editor of choice, go into the lua file and make these following changes
**** On line 87, the themes are listed there
**** On line 100, change the number inside the brackets to get the theme you want
**** On line 103, you can change which terminal you want in the quotes
**** On line 107, you can change which browser will launch
**** On line 807-811, you can comment out sloppy if you want
**** At the end of the file, add this line for gaps
***** --Gaps
***** beautiful.useless_gap = 5
**** At the end of the file, we will also declare which applications we want such as nitrogen for wallpaper and picom for transparency
***** awful.spawn.with_shell("picom")
***** awful.spawn.with_shell("nitrogen --restore")
****** We add --restore to restore the wallpaper we had
**** On line 550, we want super + r to run dmenu. Replace that line with this line:
***** awful.key({ modkey }, "r", function () awful.util.spawn("dmenu_run") end,
**** On line 551, replace "run prompt" to something like dmenu to show up in cheatsheet
